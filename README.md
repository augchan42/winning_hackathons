# Winning Hackathons

## About This Talk

This is a session for high school students on how to win hackathons, based on winning a track at Consensus HK 2025.

## The Reality Check

Here's the secret: These hackathons are positioned as work done over 1 day or several days. But in reality, you may be competing with projects that have been operating for months or years.

That's not a reason to give up—it's a reason to play smarter.

## Mindset First: Redefine Winning

**Don't worry too much about winning, especially if it's your first one.**

Instead, focus on:
- Getting the hang of how hackathons work
- Building a base of code and materials you can reuse for future hackathons
- Learning to present under pressure

What actually happens is—winning teams often come with pre-existing work. In my case, I won with a project that was already working (an AI agent posting to Twitter), but I extended it to use technology that was sponsoring one of the hackathon tracks.

## Understanding the Game: Theater + Engineering

**Hackathons are not exams. They're theater + engineering.**

Judges aren't asking:
> "Is this the most elegant code?"

They're asking:
> "Is this interesting, relevant to our ecosystem, and clearly explained under time pressure?"

That reframing alone helps you relax and play smarter.

## Strategy 1: Pick a Narrow, Finishable Idea

Many first-time teams lose because they aim too big.

**Strong heuristic:**
> *One clear problem + one sponsor technology + one visible outcome.*

Not five features. Not a platform. One thing that works and can be shown.

My winning project demonstrates this:
- **One agent** (Twitter bot)
- **One integration** (OriginTrail knowledge graph)
- **One unusual data domain** (I-Ching divinations)

That combination is memorable.

## Strategy 2: Understand Sponsor Perspective

Hackathons typically have sponsors. **Sponsors are not villains—they're customers.** They're paying to see interesting projects that make their technology look good.

Think from their perspective: Is this something engaging, with good technical depth, that people THEY are marketing to would find interesting?

In my case, OriginTrail has a specialized database called a knowledge graph. I integrated my Twitter agent to persist data into OriginTrail's database. And my agent was persisting I-Ching divinations (an area I'm very interested in, but also quite niche/different/interesting).

Understanding other people's perspectives will serve you well in hackathons—and in life.

## Strategy 3: Presentation > Code

**Your presentation is more important than your code.**

Brush up your presentation skills, or team up with someone who is a good presenter and storyteller. In the face of AI, real humans, real human presentation, and real human storytelling are even more important than before.

**You may only have 90 seconds to a few minutes to present your project.**

- Practice your presentation with a timer
- Tell a good story
- Highlight anything you particularly liked about the sponsor technology you're building upon or integrating with

## Strategy 4: Judges Reward Direction, Not Completeness

This is especially important to understand:

**You don't need to finish the whole product.**

You need to show **where it's going** and why that direction matters.

A rough demo + a convincing "next step" often beats a polished but boring app.

## Real Example: My Winning Project

**Project:** AI agent that posts I-Ching divinations to Twitter, with OriginTrail knowledge graph integration

**GitHub:** https://github.com/augchan42/eliza/tree/feature/dkg-twitter-integration

## Final Thought

> "If you leave a hackathon with reusable code, better presentation skills, and one new way of thinking—you already won."

Good luck out there.
